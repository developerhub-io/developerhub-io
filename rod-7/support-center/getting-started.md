## Why should I use %product%?

%product% provides you with the simplest way ever to have your documentation written. But don't take our word for it, try it out. Everything you need to do on %product% is literally a click away from you. %product% decreases the time needed by your team to have a functional documentation up and running, allowing them to focus on the most important part: _Writing the perfect documentation_.

%product% is the only platform that you, your techie and non-techie writers, as well as your readers will love üíõ That is because:

- Beautiful clear documentation decreases your product's churn rate and helps your prospective customers understand your product. Our expert design makes sure that your documentation is so easy to navigate through üìà
- Our integrations help you reach out to customers and to track usage, allowing you provide higher customer happiness even on your documentation pages.
- Styling your content cannot be any easier. Whether your writers are tech people or not, they can format the content using a [toolbar](/support-center/formatting-text), [keyboard shortcuts](/support-center/keyboard-shortcuts), or using [Markdown](/support-center/using-markdown) syntax on the fly üë©‚Äçüíª
- You can set up a review process with powerful [user permissions](/support-center/collaboration), page [comments](/support-center/comments), [drafting](/support-center/draft-mode) and publishing capabilities.
- [Analytics](/support-center/google-analytics), [search](/support-center/using-search), [reviews](/support-center/comments), [search analytics](/support-center/search-analytics), [SEO](/support-center/seo), [link checking](/support-center/page-linking#listing-broken-links) and [feedback](/support-center/feedback) are all built in (seriously) üöÄ
- You can [host](/support-center/hosting) on your [custom domain](/support-center/using-custom-domain), on [your existing website](/support-center/hosting#hosting-under-an-existing-website), or on a [subdomain](/support-center/hosting#hosting-under-product-subdomain) of ours üîó
- We have native support for [OpenAPI 2 and 3](/support-center/api-references), with an API editor and API playground built-in, so your users can test your APIs right away and you can bring your API References close to your user guides üóÇ
- Where you edit your documentation looks the same as the live documentation. You never have to guess how it will look like when it's published üëç
- We take customisation to the next level. Completely modify the look by changing [global CSS](/support-center/custom-css) and injecting [javascript](/support-center/custom-javascript).
